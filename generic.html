							<p>Welcome
Hey there. We're just people who love plants and building things. Whether you're a designer, gardener, or curious beginner, you're welcome here.

Who we are
A global community of plant enthusiasts who believe:

    Growth happens better together
    Real > perfect (show us your half-dead ferns!)
    Good things take time (we'll wait 5 years for cherries)
    Sharing knowledge helps everyone grow

What we do
Monthly gatherings (online)
Bring your plants - thriving or struggling - and your projects, big or just scribbled on napkins. Share what you're working on, get unstuck, or just enjoy plant talk.

Ongoing community space
On our Discord, we:

    Share garden visits and plant finds
    Host "Plant ICU" rescue sessions
    Give thoughtful feedback on works-in-progress
    Run seasonal challenges (pollinator gardens, dry shade solutions)

Special experiences

    Virtual garden tours with experts
    Quarterly in-person walks for local members
    Deep-dives into specific themes like urban canopies

What makes us different
We're not about trends or competitions. Just people who:

    Care about real results, not hype
    Believe creativity grows best with support
    Know plants teach patience
    Laugh when things go sideways (meow!)

Join our growing community
Come as you are - no perfect plants or portfolios needed.
